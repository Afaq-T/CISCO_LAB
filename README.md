# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Projects

## Overview

This repository contains multiple networking projects created in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
Each project file demonstrates a complete enterprise-style network design, configuration, and troubleshooting process, using a combination of core Cisco networking technologies.

The goal of these projects is to simulate real-world network scenarios involving routing, switching, IP management, security, and redundancy.

## Technologies & Configurations Used

Each project in this repository includes the implementation of the following:

* **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** – Automatic IP address assignment to devices.
* **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)** – Logical segmentation of the network for performance and security.
* **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** – Dynamic routing protocol for optimal path selection and scalability.
* **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)** – Loop prevention and redundancy in switch networks.
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – Filtering and controlling network traffic for security.
* **Trunk Ports** – Carrying multiple VLANs over a single link between switches/routers.
* **Access Ports** – Connecting end devices to specific VLANs.

## Repository Contents

Each '.pkt' file in this repository represents a complete Packet Tracer project that uses **all the above technologies** in a single integrated network.

Example:
'''

/Project-1-Network-Design.pkt

/Project-2-Network-Design.pkt

/Project-3-Network-Design.pkt

'''

## How to Use

1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer**

   * Download and install the latest version from Cisco Networking Academy.

2. **Download or Clone This Repository**

   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/Afaq-T/CISCO_Packet_Tracer_Projects.git

   ```

3. **Open a Project File**

   * Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
   * Open any `.pkt` file from this repository.

4. **Explore the Network Topology**

   * Check VLAN assignments, IP configurations, routing tables, ACL rules, and STP status.
   * Use CLI commands (`show`, `ping`, `tracert`) to verify connectivity and routing.

## Learning Outcomes

By creating and testing these projects, I gained practical experience in:

* Building enterprise-style networks with multiple technologies in a single topology.
* Configuring dynamic IP addressing and VLAN segmentation.
* Implementing and verifying OSPF routing.
* Applying STP to ensure loop-free redundancy.
* Securing traffic with ACLs.
* Setting up trunk and access ports for VLAN communication.
